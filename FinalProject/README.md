# Client

A client has approached with with the following [statement of work](./sow.md) (which is intentionally vague) for a 6 week contract. You haven't worked with this client previously, but you want to impress them with your newly assembled team. Review the [statement of work](./sow.md), self-organize, and begin!

# Logistics

Your project has been divided into several different [milestones](./milestones). It will be up to you and your group to self-organize and complete each milestones. The milestones are somewhat linear, though they need not be completed in order. 

## Team Logistics

- Work with your team to ensure everyone has a way to work on this codebase with a common set of tools.
- Everyone should make code contributions to the repository (i.e. everyone should have some commits in the project log)
- See the project timeline
