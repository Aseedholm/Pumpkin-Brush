# Use Cases

Take another look at the Statement of Work. Read through it carefully and start identifying various tasks that you think will complete the deliverable.

Within Github.com click on the 'Projects' pane (at the top of the window) and create at least 4 columns: 'Tasks', 'In Progress', 'QA', and 'Completed'

With your team members, add at least 30 tasks that you think you will need to complete. Note, for this project you need to support all of the previous features of the previous assignments.

You can formally add some of the details of each task like a user story, but that is not required. Tasks should be desriptive enough however that they can be understood by other team members who have not written the specific task.
