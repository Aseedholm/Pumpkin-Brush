# Use Cases

Take another look at the Statement of Work. Read through it carefully and start identifying various tasks that you think will complete the deliverable.

Within Github.com click on the 'Projects' pane (at the top of the window) and create at least 4 columns: 'Tasks', 'In Progress', 'QA', and 'Completed'

With your team members, add at least 15 tasks that you think you will need to complete.
