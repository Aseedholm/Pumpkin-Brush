# Code Documentation and project structure




Your code should be fully documented using doxygen style documentation. 

There should be a logical directory structure (i.e ./src ./include ./bin ./docs) folders.

You should commit your documentation files to the repository.

You should have a .gitignore file to ignore binaries.


- Project Management Tasks  
  - [ ] Run doxygen and push your documentation to your repository in a folder called 'docs'
  - [ ] Create a youtube video of your final project working
          - This video should be no greater than 5 minutes in length. Consider it a portfolio piece showing off how your software works and what techologies you used. 
	  - Note: There should be some audio covering an introduction to your project, showing off some code of your extra feature, discussion of how you figured out what to test, and how you would improve upon the project in the future.
	  - **Put you video link here** : *your youtube/drive/dropbox/whatever link here*
