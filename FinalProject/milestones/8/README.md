# Code Documentation and project structure

Your code should be fully documented using doxygen style documentation. 

There should be a logical directory structure (i.e ./src ./include ./bin ./docs) folders.

You should commit your documentation files to the repository.

You should have a .gitignore file to ignore binaries.
