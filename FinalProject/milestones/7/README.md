	- This is especially important if you have added additional dependencies.
	- Assume someone who has not taken this class (i.e. you on the first day) would have read, build, and run your software from scratch.

*Modify this file to include instructions on how to build and run your software. Specify which platform you are running on. Running your software involves launching a server and connecting at least 2 clients to the server.*
