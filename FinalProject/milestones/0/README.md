# Planning

The first stage we learned in the software development life cycle is planning. Take a moment to look through all of the milestones and again review the Statement of Work. Come up with a timeline for completing each of the milestones and post it here.

Your Project manager will look through this when completing the first milestone check-in to ensure you have a plan.

**Fair Warning** Requirements and client needs are subject to change.
